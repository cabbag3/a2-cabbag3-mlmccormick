Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  
===


## Creature Creator
on this webpage, you can name your creature, give it an age, and select the kind of creature it is from a dropdown.

You will then recieve back your creatures information, as well as an age status:
    For my derived field, I used the "creature type" and "creature age" to determine if the creature is: young, middle aged, or very old based on the avg and max lifespan of the creature.

I used a Grid for my CSS layout, the form is in the right column, and the output/stored creatures are in the left column

I used one HTML form with multiple fields to fill out
    one is a text input, min length 1 char, max length 30 chars
    one is a dropdown selector with 8 options
    one is a number input that cannot be < 0

I used all 3 CSS selectors
    element selectors: used this for ul, ul li, ul li span, and body
    id selectors: submitButton, formTitle
    class selectors: evenFormRow, oddFormRow
